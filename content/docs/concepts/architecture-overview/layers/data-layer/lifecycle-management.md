MCP is a `Stateful Protocol` (_A subset of MCP can be made stateless using the **Streamable HTTP transport**_) that requires lifecycle management. The purpose of lifecycle management is to negotiate the capabilities that both client and server support. 
It defines a rigorous lifecycle for client-server connections that ensures proper capability negotiation and state management.

## Lifecycle Phases
1. **Initialization**: Capability negotiation and protocol version agreement
2. **Operation**: Normal protocol communication
3. **Shutdown**: Graceful termination of the connection

    end

    Note over Client,Server: Connection closed
```

### Initialization

The initialization phase **MUST** be the first interaction between client and server.
During this phase, the client and server:

* Establish protocol version compatibility
* Exchange and negotiate capabilities
* Share implementation details

The client **MUST** initiate this phase by sending an `initialize` request containing:

* Protocol version supported
* Client capabilities
* Client implementation information

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "sampling": {},
      "elicitation": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "title": "Example Client Display Name",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The server **MUST** respond with its own capabilities and information:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "title": "Example Server Display Name",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "instructions": "Optional instructions for the client"
  }
}
```

After successful initialization, the client **MUST** send an `initialized` notification
to indicate it is ready to begin normal operations:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/initialized"
}
```

* The client **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than
  [pings](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/ping/) before the server has responded to the
  `initialize` request.
* The server **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than
  [pings](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/ping/) and
  [logging](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/logging/) before receiving the `initialized`
  notification.

#### Version Negotiation

In the `initialize` request, the client **MUST** send a protocol version it supports.
This **SHOULD** be the *latest* version supported by the client.

If the server supports the requested protocol version, it **MUST** respond with the same
version. Otherwise, the server **MUST** respond with another protocol version it
supports. This **SHOULD** be the *latest* version supported by the server.

If the client does not support the version in the server's response, it **SHOULD**
disconnect.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
  If using HTTP, the client **MUST** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version: <protocol-version>` HTTP header on all subsequent requests to the MCP
  server.

#### Capability Negotiation

Client and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be
available during the session.

Key capabilities include:

| Category | Capability     | Description                                                                               |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client   | `roots`        | Ability to provide filesystem [roots](/docs/concepts/client-concepts/roots)|
|
| Client   | `sampling`     | Support for LLM [sampling](/docs/concepts/client-concepts/sampling/) requests            |
|
| Client   | `elicitation`  | Support for server [elicitation](/docs/concepts/client-concepts/elicitation/) requests   |
|
| Client   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                                  |
|
| Server   | `prompts`      | Offers [prompt templates](/docs/concepts/server-concepts/prompts)                       |
|
| Server   | `resources`    | Provides readable [resources](/docs/concepts/server-concepts/resources)                 |
|
| Server   | `tools`        | Exposes callable [tools](/docs/concepts/server-concepts/tools)                          |
|
| Server   | `logging`      | Emits structured [log messages](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/logging/)       |
|
| Server   | `completions`  | Supports argument [autocompletion](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/completion/) |
|
| Server   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                                  |
{{< /table >}}

Capability objects can describe sub-capabilities like:

* `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications (for prompts, resources, and
  tools)
* `subscribe`: Support for subscribing to individual items' changes (resources only)

### Operation

During the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the
negotiated capabilities.

Both parties **MUST**:

* Respect the negotiated protocol version
* Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated

### Shutdown

During the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol
connection. No specific shutdown messages are definedâ€”instead, the underlying transport
mechanism should be used to signal connection termination:

#### stdio

For the stdio [transport](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/transport-layer/stdio), the client **SHOULD** initiate
shutdown by:

1. First, closing the input stream to the child process (the server)
2. Waiting for the server to exit, or sending `SIGTERM` if the server does not exit
   within a reasonable time
3. Sending `SIGKILL` if the server does not exit within a reasonable time after `SIGTERM`

The server **MAY** initiate shutdown by closing its output stream to the client and
exiting.

#### HTTP

For HTTP [transports](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/transport-layer/streamable-http), shutdown is indicated by closing the
associated HTTP connection(s).

## Timeouts

Implementations **SHOULD** establish timeouts for all sent requests, to prevent hung
connections and resource exhaustion. When the request has not received a success or error
response within the timeout period, the sender **SHOULD** issue a [cancellation
notification](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/cancellation/) for that request and stop waiting for
a response.

SDKs and other middleware **SHOULD** allow these timeouts to be configured on a
per-request basis.

Implementations **MAY** choose to reset the timeout clock when receiving a [progress
notification](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview/layers/data-layer/utility-features/progress/) corresponding to the request, as this
implies that work is actually happening. However, implementations **SHOULD** always
enforce a maximum timeout, regardless of progress notifications, to limit the impact of a
misbehaving client or server.

## Error Handling

Implementations **SHOULD** be prepared to handle these error cases:

* Protocol version mismatch
* Failure to negotiate required capabilities
* Request [timeouts](#timeouts)

Example initialization error:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unsupported protocol version",
    "data": {
      "supported": ["2024-11-05"],
      "requested": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```
