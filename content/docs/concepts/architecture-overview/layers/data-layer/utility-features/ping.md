The ping functionality is implemented through a simple request/response pattern. Either the client or server can initiate a ping by sending a ping request.

## Message Format

A ping request is a standard JSON-RPC request with no parameters:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "123",
  "method": "ping"
}
```

## Behavior Requirements

1. The receiver **MUST** respond promptly with an empty response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "123",
  "result": {}
}
```

2. If no response is received within a reasonable timeout period, the sender **MAY**:
   * Consider the connection stale
   * Terminate the connection
   * Attempt reconnection procedures

## Usage Patterns

    participant Sender
    participant Receiver

    Sender->>Receiver: ping request
    Receiver->>Sender: empty response
```

## Implementation Considerations

* Implementations **SHOULD** periodically issue pings to detect connection health
* The frequency of pings **SHOULD** be configurable
* Timeouts **SHOULD** be appropriate for the network environment
* Excessive pinging **SHOULD** be avoided to reduce network overhead

## Error Handling

* Timeouts **SHOULD** be treated as connection failures
* Multiple failed pings **MAY** trigger connection reset
* Implementations **SHOULD** log ping failures for diagnostics
