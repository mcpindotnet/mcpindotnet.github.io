Let's explore the official C# SDK for MCP, which offers a robust set of NuGet packages that empower .NET developers to build applications that seamlessly interact with LLMs. This guide will provide a deep dive into the three core components of the MCP SDK for .NET.

The SDK is structured as a layered architecture with three distinct packages, each serving a specific purpose in the ecosystem:

  1. [ModelContextProtocol.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol.Core)
  2. [ModelContextProtocol](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol)
  3. [ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore)

Let's examine each package in detail.
### ModelContextProtocol.Core
#### Overview
ModelContextProtocol.Core is the essential building block of the MCP ecosystem. As the minimal dependency package, it provides the fundamental client and server APIs without the overhead of additional frameworks.

#### When to use this package:

- When you need the absolute minimum dependencies
- For low-level server implementation
- When building lightweight clients
- In constrained environments where dependency count matters
#### Key Features
- Basic client/server communication
- Tool registration and invocation
- Protocol message handling
- STDIO transport implementation

### ModelContextProtocol 
#### Overview
ModelContextProtocol is the primary package for most MCP implementations in .NET. It builds upon the Core package by adding dependency injection, hosting integration, and automatic tool discovery capabilities.

#### When to use this package:
- For standard application development
- When using dependency injection
- When you need automatic tool discovery
- For most server implementations that don't require HTTP
#### Key Features
- Full dependency injection integration
- Automatic tool discovery via attributes
- Advanced server configuration
- Seamless integration with AI functions
- Hosting extensions for background services
### ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore
#### Overview
ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore extends the MCP capabilities to HTTP-based communication, allowing you to create MCP servers that operate over standard HTTP protocols.

#### When to use this package:

- When you need HTTP-based MCP servers
- For web-based integrations
- When working with cloud services that require HTTP endpoints
- For scenarios where STDIO isn't appropriate
#### Key Features
- HTTP transport implementation
- ASP.NET Core middleware integration
- Web API endpoint configuration
- Standard HTTP request/response handling
- Compatibility with existing web infrastructure


### Final Thoughts
Want to build a .NET MCP server (console or hosted)? Start with **ModelContextProtocol**.

Building an HTTP-powered MCP server in ASP.NET Core? Use **ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore**.

Need a lightweight client or minimal integration? Choose **ModelContextProtocol.Core**.

{{< alert context="warning" text="All are in preview! so expect potential breaking changesâ€”but they offer powerful foundations for LLM-tool integration within .NET." />}}

Let's build real world applications using these packages to demonstrate their capabilities.
